  Example: `feature/more-tags`

- **`fix/`:** Bug fixes or issue resolution
  Example: `fix/memory-leak`

- **`hotfix/`:** Like **`fix/`**, but when something went *REALLY WRONG*
  Example: `hotfix/security-patch`

- **`doc/`:** Documentation updates
  Example: `doc/update-readme`

- **`test/`:** Test infrastructure updates
  Example: `test/add-unit-tests`

- **`chore/`:** Routine tasks or maintenance
